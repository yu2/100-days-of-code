# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reached jQuery in freeCodeCamp. 

### Day 2: July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did a few jQuery lessons, but mostly worked on a silly project involving lots of positioning and trying out animations from Animate.css.

**Thoughts**: Didn't have a lot of time today because of work. Spent a lot of time trying different declarations in CSS, but not with a lot of headway. Still haven't figured out how to center divs in a page.

### Day 3: July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished jQuery and the tribute page.

**Link(s) to work**: [Haruki Murakami Tribute Page](http://yu2.github.io/tribute.html)

### Day 4: July 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the tribute page.

**Thoughts**: The things we have to do for the tribute page is quite overwhelming.

### Day 5: July 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished all the requirements of the portfolio project.

**Thoughts**: After much searching, reading, and copying, I finally have a passable portfolio page. I will move onto javascript tomorrow and add to the page as I go along. Bootstrap can be confusing sometimes because of the hidden CSS classes. I found that creating a new div is sometimes a good solution to get around unknown values.

### Day 6: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Halfway through Javascript lessons. Made minor improvements to social media icons on Portfolio.

### Day 10-11: August 4-8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked sporadically while on trip, made progress through Algorithms and finally solved "Chunky Monkey".

### Day 12: August 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished final Basic Algorithm challenges and got a small start on JSON and Ajax. MDN is so helpful and reading their resources often help me uncover details that help a lot in the long run.

### Day 13: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished JSON and Ajax but haven't had a chance to practice them and don't quite understand them yet.

## Day 14: August 11, 2017

**Today's Progress** Started on the Random Quotes Machine by brainstorming and then deciding on a tennis quotes page. Spent a lot of time figuring out how to make a div's height proportional to its width.

## Day 15: August 12, 2017

**Today's Progress** Made a tennis court with accurate dimensions with css, mostly using borders. Learning to use viewport units made it a lot easier. 

## Day 16: August 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced using flexbox layout.

## Day 17: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced more with flexbox and started using CSS animations and the CSS filter property. Also experimented with event listeners.
