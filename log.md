# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reached jQuery in freeCodeCamp. 

### Day 2: July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did a few jQuery lessons, but mostly worked on a silly project involving lots of positioning and trying out animations from Animate.css.

**Thoughts**: Didn't have a lot of time today because of work. Spent a lot of time trying different declarations in CSS, but not with a lot of headway. Still haven't figured out how to center divs in a page.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 3: July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished jQuery and the tribute page.

**Link(s) to work**: [Haruki Murakami Tribute Page](http://yu2.github.io/tribute.html)

### Day 4: July 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the tribute page.

**Thoughts**: The things we have to do for the tribute page is quite overwhelming.

### Day 5: July 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished all the requirements of the portfolio project.

**Thoughts**: After much searching, reading, and copying, I finally have a passable portfolio page. I will move onto javascript tomorrow and add to the page as I go along. Bootstrap can be confusing sometimes because of the hidden CSS classes. I found that creating a new div is sometimes a good solution to get around unknown values.
