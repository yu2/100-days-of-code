# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Yu2

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 26, 2017].

## Log

### R1D25 (Sep 8, 2017) 
Finished layout and API call of weather page. Becoming more familiar with jQuery after the SoloLearn lessons.

### R1D26 (9/10)
Finished all of weather page except Celsius/Fahrenheit switching.

### R1D27 (9/11)
Working on switching between C/F, but click events are not working after making an ajax call.

### R1D28 (9/12)
Finished Weather app. Found out that click events weren't working because the z-indexes of the elements were below the body.

### R1D29 (9/26)
Finished a rough version of the Wikipedia Viewer that can fulfill the user stories, but haven't decided if I'm going to show more information about each result than just the title. Also need to add some more in the way of aethetics.

### R1D30 (9/27)
Added random colors to the buttons in the Wikipedia Viewer, changed the icons, and other small changes. What's left are the aesthetics.

### R1D31 (9/28)
Finished Wikipedia Viewer by adding page snippets, Wikipedia colour theme, search bar, icons, and fixing flex-shrink.

### R1D32 (9/30)
Started layout for Twitch API. Wondering how to improve the site skeleton.

### R1D33 (10/3)
Streamlined website layout, picked colours, and made a successful call to Twitch API v5. Wondering how best to efficiently fetch several channels at once.

### R1D34 (10/4)
Added some simple fading effects. Tried layering but ended up breaking some stuff and then having to fix them. Tomorrow will try ordering with the align-self property.

### R1D35 (10/5)
Modified design to enable search for each channel box. The JS side has not been modified, so only the first searchbox works right now. Another problem will be gathering multiple searchboxes and binding the same click event to them, and have that event get the id of the element it is being called from. 

### R1D36 (10/6)
Fixed event listeners so that they would affect the right elements. Now all three boxes are functional. 

### R1D37 (10/7)
Finally got overlaying boxes to work by using absolute positioning correctly. Also added channel art. Next will make design tweaks and learn about making the page mobile-friendly.


### R1D38 (10/9)
Streamlined JS code by setting some parts in HTML, added links and got them to work correctly, changed layout of logos and other components to be more responsive.

### R1D39 (10/10)
Finished Twitch API app. Had a scare when Client ID stopped working and started returning error 400, but turns out I had the wrong ID. No idea why it was working before. Also changed color theme, added preview, and made it check for FFC status as per user story requirement.

### R1D40+41 (10/18)
Updated Twitch viewer and started working on Quichua syntactic parser. So far it only generates simple affixes and roots and can't actually do any actual parsing yet.

### R1D42 (10/19)
Tweaked and added to the skeleton of the parser project. Made search forms work and adjusted layout.

### R1D43 (10/21)
Added functionality - now can parse one root followed by one or more suffixes. Made font a little bigger and changed default text in input form. 

### R1D44 (10/27)
Worked on algorithms and made a simple roman numeral converter.

### R1D45 (10/29)
Revisited an old site and experimented with making a sticky navigation bar.

### R1D46 (11/5)
Algorithms (wherefore art thou) and toggleable menu.

### R1D47 (11/6)
Algorithm (search and replace) and tried to make console items appear one by one without success.

### R1D48 (11/7)
Algorithm (pig latin), made console messages appear one by one with jQuery's show(), added some aesthetics.

### R1D49 (11/8)
Algorithm (DNA Pairing), added ability to enter text to mock console, fixed scrolling, and used JSON.stringify to better display arrays.

### R1D50 (11/9)
Algorithms (to Boo Who), begun to learn about importing and reading files.

### R1D51 (11/10)
Algorithms (worked on Sorted Union) and beginning to convert file to new format.

### R1D52 (11/16)
Algorithms (Sorted Union and Convert HTML Entities). Also worked on parsing text file into JSON format. 

### R1D53 (11/17)
Algorithm (Spinal Tap) with regular expressions. 

### R1D54 (11/18)
Algorithm (Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers), thought about the next one.

### R1D55 (11/20)
Algorithms (Sum All Primes, Smallest Common Multiple, Finders Keepers).

### R1D56 (11/21)
Algorithm (Drop It), Kata (Binary Addition).

### R1D57 (11/22)
Completed kata (Descending Order, Balance Points) and worked on an algorithm (Steamroller).

### R1D58 (11/23)
Algorithm (Steamroller, Binary Agent), kata (Most Likely).  

### R1D59 (11/24)
Algorithm (Everything Be True), redesigned parser in anticipation of updating functionality.

### R1D60 (11/29)
Algorithm (Arguments Optional), revisited parser and file projects.

### R1D61 (11/30)
Algorithms (Validate US Phone Numbers, Record Collection).

### R1D62 (12/14)
Algorithm (Symmetric Difference).

### R1D63 (12/15)
Algorithm (Exact Change).

### R1D64 (12/17)
Algorithm (Inventory Update).

### R1D65 (12/20)
Working on No Repeats Please, learned about momoization.

### R1D66 (12/30)
Working on No Repeats Please, now working correctly for three-character sequences.

### R1D67 (1/8)
No Repeats Please working on most cases.

### R1D68 (1/11)
No Repeats Please working now.

### R1D69 (1/22)
Completed TryGit course from Code School. Trying to reorganize repository.

### R1D70 (1/26)
Started reading chapter 1 of You Don't Know Javascript, halfway through.

### R1D71 (1/27)
Organized repository and resumed work on Parser. Added upload button and functionality.

### R1D72 (1/29)
Continued working on Parser. Changing to a tabbed layout. Still getting to know flexbox layout.

### R1D73 (1/31)
Made flexbox tabs work, but having issues with sizing and shrinking.

### R1D74 (2/2)
Learned about loops and matrices in R to help someone solve a problem.

### R1D75 (2/9)
Finished Chapter 1 of You Don't Know Javascript and completed the practice problem.

### R1D76, 77, 78 (2/16)
Finished "Up and Going" of YDKJS, worked on practice questions from Chapters 1 and 2.

### R1D79 (2/17)
Practiced modularization by creating a signup/login page, then spent some time to tweak it on mobile.

### R1D80 (2/18)
Begun reading the Scope & Closure book of YDKJS.
