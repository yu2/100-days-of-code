The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 17, Monday, 2017].

## Log

### R1D25 (Sep 8, 2017) 
Finished layout and API call of weather page. Becoming more familiar with jQuery after the SoloLearn lessons.

### R1D26 (9/10)
Finished all of weather page except Celsius/Fahrenheit switching.

### R1D27 (9/11)
Working on switching between C/F, but click events are not working after making an ajax call.

### R1D28 (9/12)
Finished Weather app. Found out that click events weren't working because the z-indexes of the elements were below the body.
