The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 17, Monday, 2017].

## Log

### R1D25 (Sep 8, 2017) 
Finished layout and API call of weather page. Becoming more familiar with jQuery after the SoloLearn lessons.

### R1D26 (9/10)
Finished all of weather page except Celsius/Fahrenheit switching.

### R1D27 (9/11)
Working on switching between C/F, but click events are not working after making an ajax call.

### R1D28 (9/12)
Finished Weather app. Found out that click events weren't working because the z-indexes of the elements were below the body.

### R1D29 (9/26)
Finished a rough version of the Wikipedia Viewer that can fulfill the user stories, but haven't decided if I'm going to show more information about each result than just the title. Also need to add some more in the way of aethetics.

### R1D30 (9/27)
Added random colors to the buttons in the Wikipedia Viewer, changed the icons, and other small changes. What's left are the aesthetics.

### R1D31 (9/28)
Finished Wikipedia Viewer by adding page snippets, Wikipedia colour theme, search bar, icons, and fixing flex-shrink.
