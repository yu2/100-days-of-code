The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 17, Monday, 2017].

## Log

### R1D25 (Sep 8, 2017) 
Finished layout and API call of weather page. Becoming more familiar with jQuery after the SoloLearn lessons.

### R1D26 (9/10)
Finished all of weather page except Celsius/Fahrenheit switching.

### R1D27 (9/11)
Working on switching between C/F, but click events are not working after making an ajax call.

### R1D28 (9/12)
Finished Weather app. Found out that click events weren't working because the z-indexes of the elements were below the body.

### R1D29 (9/26)
Finished a rough version of the Wikipedia Viewer that can fulfill the user stories, but haven't decided if I'm going to show more information about each result than just the title. Also need to add some more in the way of aethetics.

### R1D30 (9/27)
Added random colors to the buttons in the Wikipedia Viewer, changed the icons, and other small changes. What's left are the aesthetics.

### R1D31 (9/28)
Finished Wikipedia Viewer by adding page snippets, Wikipedia colour theme, search bar, icons, and fixing flex-shrink.

### R1D32 (9/30)
Started layout for Twitch API. Wondering how to improve the site skeleton.

### R1D33 (10/3)
Streamlined website layout, picked colours, and made a successful call to Twitch API v5. Wondering how best to efficiently fetch several channels at once.

### R1D34 (10/4)
Added some simple fading effects. Tried layering but ended up breaking some stuff and then having to fix them. Tomorrow will try ordering with the align-self property.

### R1D35 (10/5)
Modified design to enable search for each channel box. The JS side has not been modified, so only the first searchbox works right now. Another problem will be gathering multiple searchboxes and binding the same click event to them, and have that event get the id of the element it is being called from. 

### R1D36 (10/6)
Fixed event listeners so that they would affect the right elements. Now all three boxes are functional.
